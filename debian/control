Description: utility to receive RAS error tracings
 rasdaemon is a RAS (Reliability, Availability and Serviceability) logging
 tool.  It currently records memory errors, using the EDAC tracing events.
 EDAC are drivers in the Linux kernel that handle detection of ECC errors
 from memory controllers for most chipsets on x86 and ARM architectures.
 This userspace component consists of an init script which makes sure EDAC
 drivers and DIMM labels are loaded at system startup, as well as a utility
 for reporting current error counts from the EDAC sysfs files.
